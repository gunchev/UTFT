# UTFT Library (Unofficial)

The UTFT Library is written by Henning Karlsen (see: http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=51).

This version is modified to support my ILI9225 based 2.2" display.

I (Doncho Gunchev) ported these changes from the CD I got with my display from a modified older version of the library.

This version IS NOT SUPPORTED by Henning Karlsen. If you have problems - create issue on GitHub.
